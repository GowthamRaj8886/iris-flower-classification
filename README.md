# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This beginner-friendly machine learning project aims to classify iris flowers into three species â€” **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** â€” based on the length and width of their sepals and petals.

The project walks through a complete machine learning workflow, including:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data visualization
- Model building using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report
