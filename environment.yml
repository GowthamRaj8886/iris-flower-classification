## 📌 Key Features

- Loaded and explored the classic Iris dataset
- Visualized relationships between features using pairplots
- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Suggested future improvements and project extensions

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Experiment with other classification algorithms like:
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Deploy the model as a simple **Streamlit web app**
- Add a `requirements.txt` file for easy environment setup
